# Fish Mix Skin #
This skin is made using some of my own resources as well as components from [y36](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/y36), [Haskorion](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/haskorion), [xi9w](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/xi9w), [MeowPaz](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/meowpaz), and [charuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/charuri).

## Updates: ##
- Fish Mix v1 - Initial version
- Fish Mix v1.1 - Update skin elements (using a very slightly different color scheme which should be easier on the eyes)
- Fish Mix v1.2 - Use skin elements from the O2Jam U Ultimate skin for mania.
- Fish Mix v1.3 - Hit elements are darker so Kiai time is less distracting.
- Fish Mix v2 - Completely new style for standard. Uses new score letters and new hit indicators. Sliders and circles are different colors.
- Fish Mix v2.1 - New mod icons
- Fish Mix v2.2 - Fix approach circle on low resolution
- Fish Mix v2.3 - Change default cursor color
- Fish Mix v2.4 - Add spinner assets, fix approach circles, make the cursor nicer, and change the color scheme
- Fish-Ameliorate - This is a new skin I found and have since modified to be slightly better. It is a lot easier to read than the old skin. I will create new assets for the Fish-Skin to make it more similar to this skin.

This project is my attempt to make an osu skin from scratch

# Fish Skin, the first skin I made (deprecated) #
Osu Fish Skin Final Version (will be released officially if all owners of the original files give the ok)

This Osu Skin is made with pieces from Cookiezi's old skin (SameSkinButNoHitCirclesWierdName) as well as the charui_skin_1_2, Brighter-Lights, and various elements from http://osuskinner.com/

I plan on redoing most of this skin in a Ship of Theseus style (little by litle one piece at a time until the whole thing is different).
I have started a new skin from scratch (not using any elements from existing skins) at OsuFishNew: https://github.com/mrlinuxfish/OsuFishNew


## Updates: ##
- Fish 1.2.2 - Changed sliderpoints and object numbers to match score and combo numbers.
- Fish 1.2.3 - Changed Cursor, Menu button backgrounds, Input overlay, and Menu background images.
